# Simulating-Canadian-Elections

Voting theory is the study of voting systems. A voting system is an algorithm for computing the winner of an
election given a list of candidates and a set of ballots. For example, you may be familiar with the Plurality voting
system: each voter marks their ballot for exactly one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes is elected.
There are dozens of different voting systems and many different types of ballots. In this assignment, we'll be
investigating five systems (Plurality, Approval Voting, Range Voting, Borda Count, and Instant Run-Off) that use
four different types of ballots.

Canadian Elections: Ridings, Members of Parliament, and the House of Commons

Canada is divided into 338 geographical areas called ridings. In a standard Canadian election, one candidate from
each political party runs in each riding. Each riding's voters elect one of these candidates to the government using
the Plurality voting system. These elected Members of Parliament (MPs) get a seat in the House of Commons. (So,
there are 338 seats in the House of Commons.)
At present, there are five parties represented in the House of Commons; four of them put forward candidates in all
provinces. To simplify matters, our sample input data includes only those four parties:
the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC)
the Green Party
the Liberal Party
the New Democratic Party (NDP)
